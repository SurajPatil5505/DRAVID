# Disaster Response AI Video Integration and Distribution

Open source project for "Distributed AI Video Stream Processing for Disaster Response"

# Overview:

The project focuses on building a distributed system for processing, analyzing, and visualizing live video streams using AI. This system can handle real-time streams from multiple edge devices (e.g., drones, IoT cameras) and provides actionable insights in critical scenarios such as disaster management, surveillance, or industrial automation.

# Key features:

## Real-time AI Processing:

1. Performs edge AI inference to detect objects, people, or anomalies directly on devices like Raspberry Pi or drones.
2. Reduces latency by processing data locally before sending it over the network.

## Distributed Architecture:

1. Uses edge devices for localized processing and a central system for advanced analytics and visualization.
2. Ensures scalability by distributing computation across multiple devices.

## Secure Data Transmission:

1. Encrypts video streams using AES and transmits metadata via lightweight protocols like MQTT.
2. Employs WebRTC for low-latency video streaming.

## Centralized Insights and Analytics:

1.Aggregates video streams and metadata into a single command center.
2.Generates actionable insights like heatmaps, object tracking, and incident detection.
3.Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## Immutable Metadata Logging:

1. Logs metadata and analytics results to a blockchain for traceability and auditing.
2. Ensures data integrity for critical applications like law enforcement or rescue missions.

# Use Cases:

## Disaster Management:

1. Identify survivors, hazards, or affected areas in real-time using drones.
2. Coordinate rescue operations based on actionable insights.

## Smart Surveillance:

1. Monitor multiple locations using IoT cameras with AI for threat detection.
2. Alert security personnel for intrusions or suspicious activities.

## Industrial Automation:

1. Analyze video feeds from factory floors to detect equipment faults or operational inefficiencies.
2. Optimize resource allocation using heatmaps and advanced analytics.

## Wildlife Monitoring:

1. Track animals in forests using edge AI to detect and analyze movement patterns.
2. Prevent poaching by flagging unusual activities.
